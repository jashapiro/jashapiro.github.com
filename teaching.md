# Teaching

Below are brief descriptions of some the courses that I have designed and taught recently, including links to syllabus documents.

## Introduction to Genomics and Bioinformatics

An introduction to the study of genomes and genomic data. This course will examine the types of biological questions that can be answered using large biological data sets, while exploring the computational methods and techniques used for that analysis.

## Evolutionary Genetics and Genomics

This seminar course will discuss evolution primarily at the level of genes and genomes. Topics will include the roles of selection and drift in molecular evolution, evolution of gene expression, genomic approaches to the study of quantitative variation, evolutionary history of humans, and evolutionary perspectives on the study of human disease. Students will read papers from the primary literature, lead and participate in class discussions and debates, and write reviews of research articles.

## Experimental Design and Statistics

An introductory course in designing experiments and analyzing biological data. This course is structured to develop students' understanding of when to apply different quantitative methods, and how to implement those methods using the `R` statistics environment. Topics include summary statistics, distributions, randomization, replication, parametric and nonparametric tests, and introductory topics in multivariate and bayesian statistics. The course is geared around weekly problem sets and interactive learning.
