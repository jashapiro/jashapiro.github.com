# Teaching

Below are brief descriptions of some the courses that I have designed and taught recently, including links to syllabus documents.

## Introduction to Genomics and Bioinformatics
<blockquote> We shift over our fingers the first grains of this great outpouring of information and say to ourselves that the world be helped by it.<br>…one small link in the chain from biochemistry and mathematics to sociology and medicine.

Genomic technologies, which allow

The proliferation of genomic technology has fundamentally transformed biology, making previously laborious and expensive experiments easier and cheaper, enabling entirely new areas of research and fundamentally altering all fields of biology and medicine. This course will introduce you to the questions that can be asked and answered with genomic data, and to the computational tools available to analyze that data.
An introduction to the study of genomes and genomic data. This course will examine the types of biological questions that can be answered using large biological data sets, while exploring the computational methods and techniques used for that analysis.

## Evolutionary Genetics and Genomics
<blockquote>…nothing makes sense in biology except in the light of evolution, <em>sub specie evolutionis</em>.
<cite><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodosius_Dobzhansky'> Theodosius Dobzhansky</a><br>(<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/icb/4.4.443">Dobzhansky 1964</a>)</cite>
</blockquote>

This seminar course will discuss evolution primarily at the level of genes and genomes. Topics will include the roles of selection and drift in molecular evolution, evolution of gene expression, genomic approaches to the study of quantitative variation, evolutionary history of humans, and evolutionary perspectives on the study of human disease. Students  read papers from the primary literature, lead and participate in class discussions and debates, and write reviews of research articles.

## Experimental Design and Statistics

<blockquote>Statistics is applied philosophy of science. 
<cite><a href='http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~apd/'>A. P. Dawid</a><br>(<a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/statistics-a-very-short-introduction/oclc/216938494">Hand 2008</a>)</cite>
</blockquote>

This course is designed to introduce the concepts and tools of statistics and quantitative methods in a biological context. In addition to description of classical statistical methods, a substantial portion of the course is devoted to discussion of the how the concepts of statistics inform the design of experiments. We also explore the interpretation of data from experiments and observations that are not designed to an ideal standard (also known as *data*). A critical component of the class is the computational lab which introduces the [`R` statistics environment](http://www.r-project.org), a powerful and flexible system that is rapidly becoming the standard for statistical analysis in biology and elsewhere. We work with actual biological data as much as possible, learning how to handle issues like violations of assumptions, non-standard distributions, and multiple testing. Using `R` also allows the exploration of computationally intensive techniques such as simulation, permutation testing, and bootstrapping.
