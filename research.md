# Research

My research primarily focuses on the relationship between genetic variation and the path of evolution. Natural selection requires  genetic variation to act upon, but the action of selection removes that variation from the population. My work explores the interplay between these forces using genomic data from many individuals and multiple populations in order to create an unbiased picture of genetic variation across a species.

Much of my work has involved studying natural populations of organisms that have been long been used as laboratory models: the 'fruit' fly *Drosophila melanogaster*, the nematode *Caenorhabditis elegans*, and the budding yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. Most laboratory studies in these organisms are performed using the progeny of a small number of strains (often only one). While this approach has led to many great advances in biology, understanding the variation present in the species allows us to put those

it is critical that we also understand the  there is much to be learned by understandednd imthe variation among strains is usually not examined, This allows me to take advantage of the considerable knowledge of the biological community, while providing a broader perspective to the discoveries
