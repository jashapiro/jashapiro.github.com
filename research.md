# Research

My research primarily focuses on the relationship between genetic variation and the path of evolution. Natural selection requires  genetic variation to act upon, but the action of selection removes that variation from the population. My work explores the interplay between these forces, using genomic data from many individuals and multiple populations in order to create an unbiased picture of genetic variation across a species.

Much of my work has involved studying natural populations of organisms that have been long been used as laboratory models: the 'fruit' fly *Drosophila melanogaster*, the nematode *Caenorhabditis elegans*, and the budding yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. Most laboratory studies in these organisms are performed using the a small number of strains (often only one). While this approach has led to many great advances in biology, it may miss the biological richness present in natural populations. Understanding the variation present in the species as a whole will allow us to better apply those findings to natural populations and to better understand biological pathways that are unusual or simply not present in the strains that were chosen for (and have often become adapted to) laboratory life.
