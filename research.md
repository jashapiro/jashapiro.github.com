# Research

My research focuses on the relationship between genetic variation and the path of evolution. Natural selection requires  genetic variation to act upon, but the action of selection removes that variation from the population. My work explores the interplay between these forces, using genomic data from many individuals and multiple populations in order to create an unbiased picture of genetic variation across a species.

Much of my work has involved studying natural populations of organisms that have been long been used as laboratory models: the 'fruit' fly *Drosophila melanogaster*, the nematode *Caenorhabditis elegans*, and the budding yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. Most laboratory studies in these organisms are performed using the progeny of a small number of strains (often only one). While this approach has led to many great advances in biology, understanding the variation present in the species allows us to put laboratory findings in context. At the same time, the variation  present in natural populations can be very different from the mutations that are commonly induced in the lab, making natural varaints a rich source of information that we can use to make new discoveries.


## Global selective sweeps in *C. elegans*

*Caenorhabditis elegans* is a globally distributed species of nematode that lives in decaying plant material and soil. It has been used as a model for developmental biology and genetics for over 50 years, with work on the species resulting in three Nobel prizes. Almost all of this work was done using a single strain, but there has long been interest in the natural variation and population genetics of the species.

*C. elegans* was known to have fairly low genetic diversity (a level similar to humans), and it was widely suspected that this low diversity was largely the result of the fact that *C. elegans* is a selfing hermaphrodite (with rare males), a life history that tends to result in greater power for purifying selection. Even mutations with very small negative effects will tend to be eliminated fairly quickly by natural selection, taking with them neutral variation, in a process called [background selection](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8375663?dopt=Abstract "Charlesworth et al. The effect of deleterious mutations on neutral molecular variation.").

Together with [Erik Andersen](http://www.princeton.edu/~eca "Erik Andersen's Homepage") and Justin Gerke, I undertook a larg-scale study of the global and genomic diversity of *C. elegans*, examining over 200 strains using high-throughput sequencing. We began by confirming the general patterns of diversity that had previously been observed using smaller data sets, but our data allowed us to see patterns that had never been appreciated before. Not only was overall diversity low, but on three of the six *C. elegans* chromosomes, large regions were completely identical across strains collected from all over the globe. These long blocks of identity are compelling evidence for the presence of , or haplotypes, o  the surprising fact that in the vast majority of strains, a set of very recent and strong selective sweeps had eliminated almost all genetic variation from large regions of four of the six *C. elegans* chromosomes.
