<h1>Research</h1>

<p>Most generally, I am interested in the relationship between genetic variation and the path of evolution. Natural selection requires genetic variation to act upon, but that very action of selection removes variation from the population. My work explores the interplay between these forces by genomic data from many individuals and multiple populations in order to create an unbiased picture of genetic variation across a species.</p>
