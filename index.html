My research lately has focused on the global population genomics of the yeast <span class='species'><a title="Saccharomyces Genome Database" href="http://www.yeastgenome.org/">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</a> </span>and the nematode <span class='species'><a title="Wormbase" href="http://www.wormbase.org/">Caenorhabditis elegans</a></span>.

This website is  a bit of a placeholder for the moment, but it is expanding slowly with more information about my research and teaching. You can always find a fairly current listing of my publications at <a href="http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MOeyMcoAAAAJ">Google Scholar</a>, and you can follow me on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jashapiro">@jashapiro</a>.
