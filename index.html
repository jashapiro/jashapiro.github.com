<p class="lead">The Shapiro Lab at <a href="http://brynmawr.edu">Bryn Mawr College</a> studies the evolutionary genetics of yeast and other organisms. Using a variety of genomic approaches, we hope to understand the history of evolution, and to contribute to understanding of the events and forces that contribute to the genetic diversity of populations and species.
