    <p>I am an Assistant Professor in the <a title="Bryn Mawr Biology" href="http://www.brynmawr.edu/biology">Department of Biology</a> at <a title="Bryn Mawr College" href="http://www.brynmawr.edu/">Bryn Mawr College</a>. I identify primarily as an evolutionary biologist, with interests in population genetics, quantitative genetics, genomics, and bioinformatics. This is my website, in case that was not clear.

    <p>Before coming to Bryn Mawr, I was a postdoc in the <a title="Kruglyak Lab" href="http://www.princeton.edu/genomics/kruglyak/">Kruglyak Lab</a>, part of the  <a title="Lewis-Sigler Institute" href="http://www.princeton.edu/genomics/">Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics</a> at <a title="Princeton University" href="http://www.princeton.edu">Princeton University</a> (though the lab has now moved to <a title="UCLA" href="http://www.ucla.edu">UCLA</a>. I received my Ph.D. from the <a title="Ecology and Evolution at UofC" href="http://pondside.uchicago.edu/ecol-evol/">Department of Ecology and Evolution</a> at the <a title="University of Chicago" href="http://www.uchicago.edu">University of Chicago</a>, where I worked with <a href="http://pondside.uchicago.edu/ecol-evol/people/wu.html">Chung-I Wu</a>.
    My research lately has focused on the global population genomics of the yeast <span class='species'><a title="Saccharomyces Genome Database" href="http://www.yeastgenome.org/">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</a> </span>and the nematode <span class='species'><a title="Wormbase" href="http://www.wormbase.org/">Caenorhabditis elegans</a></span>.

<h2>Students</h2>

    <p> I am always looking for talented students who want to get their feet wet with biological research, especially if their interests align with mine (evolution, genomics, bioinformatics, etc.). If you think you might be interested in doing research in my lab, whether at the bench, in front of a computer, or even in the field, let me know.</p>
