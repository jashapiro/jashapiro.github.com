**How do you use statistics to answer questions about biology and beyond?**
This course is designed to introduce the concepts and tools of statistics in a biological context. In addition to description of classical statistical methods, a substantial portion of the course is devoted to discussion of the how the concepts of statistics inform the design of experiments. We also explore the interpretation of data from experiments and observations that are not designed to an ideal standard (also known as *data*). A critical component of the class is the computational lab which introduces the [`R` statistics environment](http://www.r-project.org), a powerful and flexible system that is rapidly becoming the standard for statistical analysis in biology and elsewhere. We work with actual biological data as much as possible, learning how to handle issues like violations of assumptions, non-standard distributions, and multiple testing. Using `R` also allows the exploration of computationally intensive techniques such as simulation, permutation testing, and bootstrapping.
